@dataclass
class State:
    """
    Represents the running state of an agent in the OpenHands system, saving data of its operation and memory.

    - Multi-agent/delegate state:
      - store the task (conversation between the agent and the user)
      - the subtask (conversation between an agent and the user or another agent)
      - global and local iterations
      - delegate levels for multi-agent interactions
      - almost stuck state

    - Running state of an agent:
      - current agent state (e.g., LOADING, RUNNING, PAUSED)
      - traffic control state for rate limiting
      - confirmation mode
      - the last error encountered

    - Data for saving and restoring the agent:
      - save to and restore from a session
      - serialize with pickle and base64

    - Save / restore data about message history
      - start and end IDs for events in agent's history
      - summaries and delegate summaries

    - Metrics:
      - global metrics for the current task
      - local metrics for the current subtask

    - Extra data:
      - additional task-specific data
